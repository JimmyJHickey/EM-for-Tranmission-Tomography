# Finite Sample Properties of the EM Algorithm Applied to Transmission Tomography
## Jimmy Hickey, Alvin Sheng, Eric Yanchenko

We successfully implement an EM algorithm on simulated CT scans. After showing the mathematical derivations and framework of the EM algorithm, we demonstrate its effectiveness on images of different patterns and sizes. We show that as the number of projection angles increases, the scan greatly improves in quality, whereas larger images are harder to capture accurately.
